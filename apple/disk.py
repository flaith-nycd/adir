Read CATALOG of a dsk

* Catalog Sector Format
00    - Not used
01    - Track number of next catalog sector (usually $11)
02    - Sector number of next catalog sector
03-0A - Not used
0B-2D - First File Description Entry
2E-50 - Second File Description Entry
51-73 - Third File Description Entry
74-96 - Fourth File Description Entry
97-B9 - Fifth File Description Entry
BA-DC - Sixth File Description Entry
DD-FF - Seventh File Description Entry

* File Descriptive Entry format
00    - Track of first track/sector list sector
        if this is a deleted file, the byte contains a hex
        $FF and the original track number is copied to the
        last byte of the file name field (Byte $20)
        If this byte contains a hex $00, the entry is assumed
        to never have been used and is available for use.
        (This means track $00 can never be used for data even
        if the DOS image is "wiped" from the diskette.)
01    - Sector of first track/sector list sector
02    - File Type and Flag :
            hex 80 + file type  -> file is locked
                00 + file type  -> file is not locked
                00 -> TEXT file
                01 -> INTEGER BASIC file
                02 -> APPLESOFT BASIC file
                04 -> BINARY file
                08 -> S type file
                10 -> RELOCATABLE object module file
                20 -> A type file
                40 -> B type file
            (thus, 84 is a locked BINARY file , and 90 is a
            locked R type file)
03-20 - File name (30 characters)
21-22 - Length of file in sectors (LO/HI format).
        The CATALOG command will only format the LO byte of
        this length giving 1-255 but a full 65535 may be
        stored here.
